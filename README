Steps for making and testing:

Making:
  1.  You should have copies of the files contained in the zip with this
      README which are owned by the primary user. Navigate to the Makefile
      directory and run
        > make
      make will create the protected directory at /home/spool_user/.spool_queue/
      as well as the directory which will contain the executables at
      /home/spool_user/bin/. make will also set up all necessary permissions.

  2.  In order to allow user1 and user2 to access the commands, you must make
      /home/spool_user/bin/ is on the PATH by either running the following
      command or adding it to the ~/.bashrc file:
        > export PATH=/home/spool_user/bin:$PATH

  3.  Any user for which you complete the previous step for will be able to run
      addqueue, showqueue, rmqueue.

Testing:
  1.  Ensure that you are acting as a user other than spool_user
  2.  Navigate to the location of the Makefile and run either of the following
      commands:
        > make test
        > make exec ARG=<input_file>
      The test target will attempt to call addqueue on 5 files, then run
      showqueue, then attempt to run rmqueue on 2 files.
      The exec target will attempt to call addqueue on the provided input
      filename, then run showqueue.
